  "text": "Given below are two statements: One is labelled as Assertion and the other one is labelled as Reason.Assertion:At 10[F0B0] C, the density of a 5M solution of KCl [atomic masses of K and Cl are 39 & 35.5 g mol-1] is x g mL-1. The solution is cooled to -21[F0B0] C. The molality of the solution will remain unchanged.  Reason:The molality of a solution does not change with temperature as mass remains unaffected with temperature.",
  "options": {
    "a": "Assertion is correct, reason is correct; reason is a correct explanation for assertion.",
    "b": "Assertion is correct, reason is correct; reason is not a correct explanation for assertion",
    "c": "Assertion is correct, reason is incorrect",
    "d": "Assertion is incorrect, reason is correct."
  },
  "key": "a",
  "hint": "Molality of solution does not depend on the temperature as it depends on the moles of solute and mass of solvent. Hence, both assertion and reason are true. STATEMENT TYPE 41. Molarity and molality of a solution of NaOH is calculated. If now temperature of the solution is increased then which of the following statement(s) is/are correct?  (i) Molarity of solution decreases  (ii) Molality of the solution increases  a) Both statements are correct  b) Statement (i) is correct only  c) Statement (ii) is correct only  d) Both statements are incorrect. Key: b"
