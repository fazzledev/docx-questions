  "text": "Given below are two statements: One is labelled as Assertion and the other one is labelled as Reason.Assertion:At 10[F0B0] C, the density of a 5M solution of KCl [atomic masses of K and Cl are 39 & 35.5 g mol-1] is x g mL-1. The solution is cooled to -21[F0B0] C. The molality of the solution will remain unchanged.  Reason:The molality of a solution does not change with temperature as mass remains unaffected with temperature.",
  "options": {
    "a": "Assertion is correct, reason is correct; reason is a correct explanation for assertion.",
    "b": "Assertion is correct, reason is correct; reason is not a correct explanation for assertion",
    "c": "Assertion is correct, reason is incorrect",
    "d": "Assertion is incorrect, reason is correct."
  },
  "key": "a",
  "hint": "Molality of solution does not depend on the temperature as it depends on the moles of solute and mass of solvent. Hence, both assertion and reason are true. STATEMENT TYPE"
