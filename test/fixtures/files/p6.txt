6.The velocity of an electron at point A1, where cross sectional area is A, v0.  The velocity of electron just the end of contraction at point B, where cross sectional area is 2A, is v1. Find the correct option.<img>a) v1 < v0b) v1 = v0c) v1 > v0d) embeddings/oleObject1.bin Key: cHint:As the electrons comes near the throat, positive charges are induced on the throat. The induced charges attract the electron and velocity increases. So v1 > v0.
