Assertion: The tyres of aircrafts are slightly conducting. Reason: If a conductor is connected to ground, the extra charge induced on conductor will flow to ground.  a) Both (A) and (R) are correct and (R) is not the correct explanation of (A) b) (A) is correct but (R) is not correct c) (A) is not correct but (R) is correct  d) Both (A) and (R) are correct and (R) is the correct explanation of (A) Key: d"
