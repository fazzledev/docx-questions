  "hint": "When a point positive charge is brought near an isolated conducting plane, some negative charge develops on the surface of the plane towards the charge and an equal positive charge develops on opposite side of the plane.  This process is called charging by induction.  So, the field at a point P on the other side of the plane is away from the plane and field lines are always perpendicular to the surface of conductor. 14. An electrically isolated hollow (initially uncharged), conducting sphere has a small positively charged ball suspended by an insulating rod from its inside surface, (see diagram). <img src=\"image_8.jpeg\"/> This causes the inner surface of the sphere to become negatively charged.  When the ball is centred in the sphere the electric field outside the conducting sphere is a) Zero b) The same as if the sphere wasn’t there c) Twice what it would be if the sphere wasn’t there d) Equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to what it would be if the sphere wasn’t there    Key:b"
