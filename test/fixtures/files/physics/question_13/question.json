  "hint": "When a point positive charge is brought near an isolated conducting plane, some negative charge develops on the surface of the plane towards the charge and an equal positive charge develops on opposite side of the plane.  This process is called charging by induction.  So, the field at a point P on the other side of the plane is away from the plane and field lines are always perpendicular to the surface of conductor."
