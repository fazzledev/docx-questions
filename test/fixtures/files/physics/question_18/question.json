  "hint": "It is true that body of vehicle is charged, when the vehicle is moving through air at high speed. Because of this, the vehicles, which are carrying highly inflammable material, have hanging chains, which touch slightly the ground. This chain transfers the charge to the ground (earth). Hence there is no harm to the vehicle."
