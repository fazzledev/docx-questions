  "hint": "When charged metallic ball touches the bottom of can, all of its charge goes to the outer surface of the can. (Net charge on a conductor lies only on its surface).When ball is withdrawn from the can, it is uncharged. When ball is placed on the disc of electroscope .Final charge on the leaves is reduced so leaves electroscope converges."
