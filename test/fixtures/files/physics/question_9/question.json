  "hint": "When charged metallic ball touches the bottom of can, all of its charge goes to the outer surface of the can. (Net charge on a conductor lies only on its surface).When ball is withdrawn from the can, it is uncharged. When ball is placed on the disc of electroscope .Final charge on the leaves is reduced so leaves electroscope converges. 10. An electroscope is given a positive charge, causing its foil leaves to separate.  When an object is brought near the top plate of the electroscope, the foils separate even further. We conclude <img src=\"image_7.png\"/> a) That the object is positively charged b) that the object is electrically neutral c) That the object is negatively charged d) none of these  Key:a"
