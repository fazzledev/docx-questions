  "hint": "All the observable charges have to be integral multiple of e. Thus if a body contains <math><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> electrons and <math><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math> protons, the total amount of charge on the body is <math><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math>e + <math><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>(-e) = (<math><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math> â€“ <math><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math>) e. Since <math><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></math> and <math><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></math> are integers, their difference is also an integer. Thus the charge on anybody is always an integral multiple of e and can be increased or decreased in terms of e."
