  "hint": "On touching the metal knob with a positively charged rod some electrons from the gold leaves get transferred to the rod making gold leaves positively charged and they get separated. When a negatively charged rod is touched with metal knob some negative charge flows to the gold leaves lessening the positive charge there and the separation between the leaves decreases."
