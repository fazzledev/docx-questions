  "hint": "Negative charge are attracted to surface of M near S by electrostatic induction and positive charges are repelled to surface of M away from S such that entire M still remain neutral (uncharged) Charge on S is also redistributed to have more charge on surface near to M due to the field set up by negative charges on M Diagram b thus best illustrates the charge distribution on both S and M."
