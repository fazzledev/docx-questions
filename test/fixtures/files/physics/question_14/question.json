  "hint": "Let the charge on the ball at centre is q, then −q charge will be induced on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. Field at any point outside the sphere due to inner charges q and −q will jointly be zero. <img src=\"image_9.png\"/> Outer charge q will produce the electric field at outside points as it would be produced by a charge at the centre. Hence, presence of sphere does not affect the electric field outside the sphere."
